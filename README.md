## About

I've always found it hard to decide what exercises to do during a workout, so I created an app that generates a random workout based on parameters you input.  Core day?Â Generate a random list of exercises and/or stretches targeting your core.  You can add, update, or delete workouts in the settings area.

## Setup

Install json-server: `npm install -g json-server`

Run `npm i`

Then `json-server --watch workouts.json`

Then, in a separate terminal run: `npm start`
